# Inflation and its Impact on US economy
Inflation has wreaked havoc on the global economy. The fate of the global economy is intrinsically connected to that of the United States, particularly in the previous two decades. Various events such as financial crises, pandemics, and government policies have caused inflation to fluctuate over the world. We're attempting to figure out which countries have the highest inflation and how the Federal Reserve adjusts interest rates to reduce inflationary pressures or boost spending to keep inflation under control in the US. In addition, how have various industries like private and government entities in various sectors performed over the previous two decades and contributed to the expansion of Gross Domestic Product of the US economy, as well as how has inflation differed in various areas such as energy, food, medical and transportation.
